# Fireworks 2021
This repository contains the Minecraft datapack for the NYE fireworks show on [Queercraft](https://www.queercraft.net/). This datapack was made on the Nova 5 map and was used for the 2021 and 2022 NYE event.  

## How to use
1. Download the datapack from the [releases](https://github.com/Queercraft/Fireworks2021/releases). It will also include a `.schem` file for the area where the fireworks will be launched from. This is necessary for the fireworks to work since they use armor stands as targets to launch from.  
2. Place this in your world's datapack folder.  
3. To launch the fireworks after a 10 second countdown, run the command `/function fireworks:countdown`. This will show titles to all players on the server. It ends in "HAPPY NEW YEAR!" and then launches the fireworks.  
Alternatively, you can run `/function fireworks:fireworks-sequence` to launch the fireworks immediately.
